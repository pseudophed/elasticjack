# elasticjack
Tool for grabbing info, documents, etc. from Elasticsearch

## Python Version
This tool has been written in Python 3. For the people who bitch about Python 3... it's been like a decade. Deal with it. It was tested with Python 3.5, but there's no crazy features here that would preclude it from working with Python 3.x. Just run it with ```python3 elasticjack <options>```, or change the #! to point to your python3 executable to ./ it.
